		Encapsulation and abstraction difference


1 Abstraction - it collects the common properties from the various objects and hides it beacuse it is focus on providing direct results without its implementation details.
1 Encapsulation - here it is used to bind the methods and data for specific object and hides it data and methods from the different objects.

2 Abstraction- it uses the abstract class and interface and they get extended by the different classes.
2 Encapsulation - it uses the scope defination to hide its data and methods that is public protected and private

3 Adstraction- it only gives the relevent data to the class 
3 Encapsulation - it protects specific objects data from diferent object.

4 Abstraction- it reduces the complexity by hiding the unnecessary code implementation 
4 Encapsulation -it wraps the data and function to reduce complexity for an class.

pesudo code:
1 encapsulation : 
class abc {
//we define the scope of variables and functions  
private: member variables 
protected: member functions
}


2 Abstraction :
Interface abc{
	public void print_name(String name);
}

// both classes can implement abc to define there own print_name function

class Employee implements abc{
	public void print_name(String name){
		System.out.println("Employee name :"+name);
	}
}
class Intern implements abc{
	public void print_name(String name){
		System.out.println("Intern name :"+name);
	}
}
